# Race

This SPA is based on communication with a server. You can create, update, delete a car (including getting random cars), start / stop every car engine, start / stop a race between all cars on a page. Also you can open winners table and sort it by number of wins and by best time.

❗❗❗ For the application to work correctly you have to run <a href="https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api">this server</a> on your computer.
